## General Information
This app allows user to check weather forecast. User can choose desired type of forecast:
temperature and conditions. The app uses plotly.express to present temperature graph
for desired amount of days. The app displays png's on the website according to actual
weather conditions. This app was originally built in streamlit during "Python Mega
Course" that I've taken part in. I decided to built this app from scratch with Flask and
Weather API, because I think it is very useful.
